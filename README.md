# RiskEngine
An Artificial Intelligence engine for the Risk Commander game. It utilizes the minimax with alpha beta pruning algorithm, in order to take the best decisions, according to the current map setting. It is currently in its early development stage, since I intend to make it a virtual board game companion, for anyone who wants to play against a real life cpu.
